## Notes

- Crafting this app was an enlightening journey through the realms of XML and the intricacies of programmatic UI styling. I delved into the nuanced art of laying out and positioning each element to achieve a fluid, adaptable interface that gracefully accommodates the diverse screen sizes of Android devices. This meticulous process ensured a consistent user experience across all devices, laying a robust foundation for the app‚Äôs design to shine on any screen.
